# DebrisTweaks
A Beat Saber plugin for tweaking various debris parameters.
Ported from [DebrisTweaksQuest](https://github.com/Raemien/DebrisTweaksQuest) into the PC version of Beat Saber.
## Configuration:
### Main
* **Enable Tweaks:** Acts as a master switch for all custom settings.
* **Force Disable Debris:** Functions similarly to YeetDebris, but is independent from the 'Reduce Debris' setting.

### Physics
* **Enable Gravity:** Should note debris react to gravity?
* **Prevent Rotations:** Should note debris rotate while in motion?
* **Velocity Multiplier:** Multiply the initial velocity of all debris by this amount.
* **Drag:** The amount of air resistance all debris experience.

### Cosmetic
* **Override Lifetime:** Sets whether the base-game lifespan system is overriden.
* **Debris Lifespan:** Time in seconds for sliced debris to disappear.
* **Debris Scale:** The relative size of sliced debris.
* **Monochrome Colors:** Make all debris colorless to reduce confusion.
